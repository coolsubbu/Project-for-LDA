HI ALL,

REPORT :

Task A: POS TAGGING   :      Program to obtain POS Tags of Sentences in Corpus:
       
      The corpus has many citations and they are concerned with citations and each citation is a multi sentence text.   
       
       First : separate the para into list of sentences using regular expression and encoding .
                 1. IF we divide the paragraphs into sentences using full stop as the separator then abbrv such "u.s.c" will give issues.  
                     So to avoid this all "u,s.c" / "i.r.s"   are replaced with a word "USC" and then divided into  sentences which follows reconverting USC to 'u.s.c'
       Secondly,   Do POS tagging using spacy library tagger  on individual sentences. 

 Task B : Semantic matching of sentences :
       
      The sentences obtained from Task A will now converted to an nlp object of spacy library and 
        Spacy semantic score is obtained via a word embedding from both sentences being compared.
       We take 5 sentences and compare them with around 6k sentences from around 5k citations.

Task C:  LDA for Topic Modelling :

     I. We proprocess individual sentences with following steps:
             a. stop word removal 
             b. Lemmatization 
             c cleaning special chars 
     II  we provide corpus to LDA with 60 TOPICS and 2000.iterations.
          a. We obtain the Topic description file which has algebraic expansion of topics 
          b. We obtain the Topic Mapping file with following columns.
